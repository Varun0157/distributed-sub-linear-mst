- [ ] create a unified vertex type that stores the fragment id - would help avoid having to send a separate dict probably
- [x] currently, separate up and down propogation steps, merge into a single with the help of a mutex (child waits for parent if not received all children edges)
  - this would mitigate the need for a received count state in the server, and reduce the amount of communication that takes place
